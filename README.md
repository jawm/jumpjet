A basic parser and runtime for WebAssembly

This project is still early in development. Currently working on the interpreter.
Track progress here:
https://trello.com/b/ync291Fb

Future plans include: 
 - Refactor pretty much everything
 - Parallelise the parsing phase
 - Add a Jit, maybe use Cretonne?
 - Documentation would be nice :)


Contributions welcome.
